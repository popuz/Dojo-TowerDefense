Welcome to the Tower Defense Coding Dojo! With the assets provided, your task is to breathe life into the game using your scripting skills. 

## 🎯 Objective:
Collaborate with your team to implement core game mechanics in the given 2-hour timeframe.

## 🎮 Available Assets:
- **Game Levels**
- **Enemies** (with animations)
- **Towers** (with animations)
- **UI Elements**
- **NavMesh**
- **Sound Effects**

## 📝 Tasks:

### 1. **Enemy Movement: 🏃**
- Script enemies to follow the NavMesh path towards the endpoint.
- Make sure different enemy types move at varied speeds.

### 2. **Tower Mechanics: 🗼**
- Implement a system for players to place towers on designated spots.
- Allow towers to shoot at approaching enemies. Prioritize the closest enemy.

### 3. **Game Progression: 🌊**
- Introduce wave-based spawning of enemies.
- Deduct player health/base health when an enemy reaches the endpoint.

### 4. **Game Economy: 💰**
- Implement a simple currency system. Players earn currency for each defeated enemy.
- Allow players to spend currency to place more towers.

### 5. **UI Interactions: 🖥️**
- Display and update the player's health, score, and available currency.
- Implement basic game controls: start, pause, and resume.

## 🚀 Tips:

- **Divide and Conquer:** Start by dividing the tasks among team members based on interest and expertise.
- **Test Often:** Regularly test your game to ensure your implementations work and to catch bugs early.
- **Stay Focused:** The time is limited, so prioritize completing the core mechanics over perfecting them.
- **Collaborate:** Communication is key. Regularly check in with your teammates and help each other out.

## 🏁 Conclusion:
At the end of the session, each team will present their implementation. Remember, the primary goal is collaboration and learning. Let's have fun and create something amazing! 🎉
